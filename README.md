# Five Design-Sheet Realization
Part of a final project on a Data Visualization Course.

HDI data source: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads

CO2 Emission data source: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators

In this project, we explore UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) data for nearly 190 countries and territories as well as regional averages.
The datasets are tabular, and contain fewer than 5000 datapoints (so as not to cause lagging in Altair).

About HDI itself:
The Human Development Index (HDI) was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone.
It is a composite measure of a nation's Longevity (Long and healthy life), Education (Knowledge), and Income (A decent standard of living).

Goals:

-Visualize how HDI varies from country to country, and how it varies across regions of the world.

-Visualize historical trends in Human Development, which year it had the best growth and which years it was in decline.

-Visualize the nexus between HDI and CO2 emission (environmental cost of human development)
