About HDI:
The United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI) seeks to quantify a country's level of prosperity based on both economic and non-economic factors. 
Non-economic factors include life expectancy, and educational attainment. Economic factors are measured by gross national income (GNI) per-capita.
